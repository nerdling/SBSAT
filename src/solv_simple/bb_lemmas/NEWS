news for release 8xx since 846
------------------------------

* switched from innter/outer to Luby style restart scheduling

* less agressive reduce schedule

* replaced watched literals with head and tail pointers

* add 'picosat_failed_assumption', which allows to avoid tracing and core
  generation, if one is only interested in assumptions in the core

* fixed a BUG in the generic iterator code of clauses
  (should rarely happen unless you use a very sophisticated malloc lib)

  - picosat_deref_top_level   (deref top level assignment)

  - picosat_measure_all_calls (per default do not measure adding time)
